Farming solution : By agventures

Krish-e –android application

-This  would allow farmers to treat their plant diseases. We 
are using Tensorflow library(Machine Learning library) to detect plant 
disease. The farmers can use their android device to scan a particular 
plant leaf which they suspect for having a plant disease. We analyse the 
plant diseases, symptoms etc and then generate proper measures to 
improve plant health.
